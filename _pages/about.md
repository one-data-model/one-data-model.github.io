# History

In the late fall of 2018, the ZigBee Alliance hosted a gathering of IoT industry leaders (Hive), including other IoT standards organizations, to get together and have a frank and open discussion about the Internet of Things; what is the current status, what are the big challenges ahead?

By far, the most frequently cited challenge was the inconsistency and lack of interoperability across the field of IoT data models. The lack of a common data model for IoT devices was seen as the biggest challenge; competition between data models is the biggest impediment to growth of the industry. The industry leaders at Hive 2018 decided to collectively work through the differences in IoT data models and deliver a converged, harmonized IoT data model to industry.

One Data Model (OneDM) was started in early 2019, consisting of several IoT SDOs (Standards Development Organizations) and IoT device and platform vendors, operating under a broad, multi-party liaison agreement.
